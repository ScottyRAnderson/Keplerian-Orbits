# Keplerian Orbit Simulation
Solar system simulation implementing Keplerian Orbital Mechanics.
<br> Executable build included of the solar system should you want to play around with it.

## Features
* **Accurate Planetary Motion**
<br> Implements Keplerian Orbital Mechanics following Kepler's laws of planetary motion to track celestial bodies through 3D space. Modified to simulate Orbitial Inclination.
<br> Added solar & side-real rotational periods & tidally locked rotations for natural satellites.
* **Star-Field Generator**
<br> Takes in real world star data from a csv data file to produce a GPU-Instanced star field.
* **Solar System Loader**
<br> Given a csv data file of planet & satellite data, a solar system may be generated with scaled astonomical bodies.
